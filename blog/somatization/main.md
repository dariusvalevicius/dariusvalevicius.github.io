# Some perspectives on somatization

I was recently reminded of an essay I wrote for a three-credit independent studies course in undergrad, for my minor in history and philosophy of science. I wrote a philosophical/historical review of somatization, otherwise known as psychosomatic syndromes/symptoms/disorders, or somatoform disorders, or... you get the idea. I decided to put it up on PsyArXiv and PhilPapers so it might be useful to some people, somewhere, who need a quick overview. It's probably the thing I've written that has best stood the test of time, by which I mean I don't think it's crap 5 years on :)

I have a fun anecdote about somatization which was useful in convincing me of the reality of the mind-body connection in illness. (I have another fun anecdote about hypnosis, but maybe I'll leave that one for another day). Ironically, I only remembered it several months after I researched and wrote the whole essay.

When I was about 20, while I was back home working a summer job, I adopted a kitten from my coworker's parents. My parents didn't want a cat in the house, so they had me stay with my new son in a slightly dilapidated camper van which we had parked in the back yard. After three days, they added, "Oh, by the way, watch out - we put down some rat poison in the van and forgot to tell you." Sure enough, the bar of poison had been thoroughly nibbled (perhaps by real rats, but my kitty seemed like the scavenging type and he could well have eaten some). I drove to the vet to get some medication and read about the effects of rat poison, which consisted of death by internal bleeding.

I was absolutely fuming that day, trying to keep a handle on my anger at my parents, and sick with anxiety, thinking I had just brought this kitten home to send him to an early grave. I went to sleep fitfully that night, and woke up the next day with eczema all over my hands, feet, and face, and psoriasis all over my elbows and scalp - totally covered. I couldn't sleep for two nights because of the itchiness and spend a few days hiding under a hoodie, feeling like a leper. It all cleared up after about a week. I have never had eczema or psoriasis before or since.

(My cat was fine. Either he hadn't ingested any rat poison, or he's just a tank and possibly immortal. I think it's probably the latter.)

So, take from that what you will! It certainly seems to me like there is something compelling about the link between the mind - particularly the emotions - and different train wrecks that can happen in our bodies. Or, as Gabor Mate puts it, you would think that autoimmune syndromes that we treat with artificial stress hormone (corticosteroids) might have something to do with stress.
