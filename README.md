# There's not much here for the moment

I may add blog posts or projects in the future. For now, you can view my art via the Instagram link in the bottom-left, follow me on Twitter, or view my CV.

To contact me, send me an email at [darius.valevicius@gmail.com](darius.valevicius@gmail.com).

"Liutas" is not my real name, but it's a Lithuanian word that sounds nice as a pseudonym.

# About me

I'm currently a PhD student at Université de Montréal, researching real-time neurofeedback modulation of fear and other emotions in the ECLIPS Lab. I previously studied the effects of music on pain at McGill University, worked as an fMRI research software developer at the Montreal Neurological Institute, and co-authored a handbook on psychometrics in mental health (in preparation) as part of a Healthy Brains, Healthy Lives initiative.

My interests are pretty wide-ranging, but mostly center around emotion, mental health, and the arts. In my free time I like to develop skills in drawing, painting, playing music, and working on video games and computational art projects. I also love climbing (bouldering) and boxing.
