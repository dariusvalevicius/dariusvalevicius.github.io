# Welcome to my page!

Thank you for stopping by.

I'm currently set to pursue my PhD in computational neuroscience at University of Montreal. I will have links to my LinkedIn, CV, and publications soon.

What might interest you more at the moment are my paintings, which I have started putting up for sale - see the page below.
