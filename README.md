# Home

Welcome to my humble personal site! I am trying to document all my work and personal projects in one place. I've recently started putting some blog posts and unpublished writing under the Blog tab.

The absolute best place to keep up with me is on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dariusliutas.bsky.social). I try to post a bit of everything, but mostly science-related stuff.

To contact me, you can DM me on Bluesky or LinkedIn, or send me an email at [darius.valevicius@gmail.com](darius.valevicius@gmail.com).

"Liutas" is not my real surname, but it's a Lithuanian word that sounds nice as a pseudonym.

# About me

I'm currently a PhD student at Université de Montréal, researching real-time neurofeedback modulation of fear and other emotions in the ECLIPS Lab. I previously studied the effects of music on pain at McGill University, worked as an fMRI research software developer at the Montreal Neurological Institute, and co-authored a handbook on psychometrics in mental health (in preparation) as part of a Healthy Brains, Healthy Lives initiative.

My interests are pretty wide-ranging, but mostly center around emotion, mental health, and the arts. In my free time I like to develop skills in drawing, painting, playing music, and working on video games and computational art projects. I also love climbing and boxing.
