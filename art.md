# Art

## Drawing and painting

You can check out some of my paintings and drawings on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/darius.liutas/). I've been working on improving them every now and then for the past four years or so. Currently, I mostly work in acrylic and graphite.

## Video games and computational art

You can also check out various video game and computational art projects I've done on my [Itch.io](https://dariusliutas.itch.io/). I'm especially proud of [Sc√®ne de la Mer](https://dariusliutas.itch.io/scene-de-la-mer), a short poetry experience meant for Google Cardboard VR, and [Sailing Sands](https://dariusliutas.itch.io/sailing-sands), a solo contribution to McGill Game Jam in 2022.
